    <h1>🚀 The ProSynth Bio Manifesto</h1>

    <blockquote>
        “Why is it that an <span class="highlight">8-year-old</span> can build a video game—but not discover a cure for cancer?”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Drug discovery should be as effortless as coding an app.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yet right now, the gates to biology are locked behind:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>expensive paywalls</li>
        <li>alphabet soup of degrees</li>
        <li>labs that burn billions of dollars</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <span class="highlight">I refuse to wait any longer.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
        I’m building <strong>ProSynth Bio</strong> — <em>the <span class="highlight">Cure-All AI Co-Pilot</span>.</em>
    </p>

    <p>
        Tools designed so intuitively that even an <span class="highlight">8-year-old</span> could take on cancer.

    <h2>What’s Already Live:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>ProtBERT turns protein strings into mathematical magic.</li>
        <li>Instant search to find molecular look-alikes in seconds.</li>
        <li>3D molecules spinning right in your browser tab.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Cool—but that’s just the opening act.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Here’s What’s Coming Next:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Mining every research paper and patent with BioBERT—so you’re never blindsided by prior art or IP traps.</li>
        <li>Inventing brand-new proteins and peptides via ProtGPT2—the kinds no human’s ever dreamed up.</li>
        <li>Predicting protein shapes and interactions with AlphaFold and molecular docking.</li>
        <li>Recommending your next experiments automatically—to save months chasing dead ends.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
        “Biotech shouldn’t be reserved for giant corporations. It should be a <span class="highlight">sandbox for everyone</span>—even the cracked high schoolers hacking molecules at 2am.”
    </blockquote>

    <hr>

    <h2>Calling All Cracked Builders:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>High schoolers who want to found tomorrow’s drug startups.</li>
        <li>College students tired of waiting for credentials before they can innovate.</li>
        <li>Indie labs betting everything on wild bio moonshots.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Because the future of biotech belongs to rebels, visionaries, and <span class="highlight">cracked builders</span> who won’t wait for permission.
